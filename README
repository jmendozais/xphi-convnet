To run this task on xeon phi first we compile the file in the host and then
copy to mic0. Because is not possible run make in xeon phi
mic0 I implemented a script to do the same task.

source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64

make 
scp -r . mic0:
scp /opt/intel/composerxe/lib/mic/libiomp5.so mic0:bstyle/libiomp5.so 
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=en_US
ssh mic0 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
sh makerun.sh
